Sure! Here's a concise flow of how a question is answered in your system, broken down into key steps:

---

### **1. Question Input**
- The user asks a question (e.g., "What is Python?").
- The question is passed to the `ChatBot.query()` method.

---

### **2. Context Retrieval**
- The system uses the **vector store** to find the most relevant pieces of information (context) from the knowledge base.
  - The question is converted into an **embedding** (a numerical representation of its meaning).
  - The vector store performs a **similarity search** to find the top `k` documents (e.g., `k=3`) whose embeddings are closest to the question's embedding.
  - These documents are retrieved along with their **metadata** (e.g., file name, source).

---

### **3. Context Preparation**
- The content of the retrieved documents is extracted and combined into a single **context string**.
- The **sources** (file names or paths) of the documents are also extracted for transparency.

---

### **4. Prompt Construction**
- A **prompt** is created for the LLM (e.g., OpenRouter). The prompt includes:
  - The **question**.
  - The **context** (retrieved documents).
  - The **sources** (file names or paths).
- Example prompt:
  ```
  Use the following context to answer the question. If you don't know the answer, say so.

  Context: Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.

  Sources: example.txt, example.md

  Question: What is Python?

  Answer:
  ```

---

### **5. LLM Response Generation**
- The prompt is sent to the LLM (e.g., OpenRouter).
- The LLM processes the prompt and generates a **response** based on the provided context.
- Example response:
  ```
  Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.
  ```

---

### **6. Response Formatting**
- The LLM's response is combined with the **sources** for transparency.
- Example formatted response:
  ```
  Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.

  Sources: example.txt, example.md
  ```

---

### **7. Output to User**
- The formatted response is displayed to the user.
- The user sees both the answer and the sources used to generate it.

---

### **Key Concepts**
1. **Embeddings**:
   - Numerical representations of text that capture meaning.
   - Used to compare the similarity between the question and documents.

2. **Similarity Search**:
   - Finds the most relevant documents by comparing embeddings.

3. **Context**:
   - The most relevant pieces of information retrieved from the knowledge base.

4. **Prompt Engineering**:
   - Crafting the input to the LLM to guide it toward the desired output.

5. **Sources**:
   - The files or documents used to generate the answer, included for transparency.

This flow ensures that the system:
- Finds relevant information efficiently.
- Provides accurate and context-aware answers.
- Maintains transparency by showing the sources.
