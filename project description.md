Project Overview
Objective:
Create a platform where professors can upload and manage course materials, announcements, and answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs). The system utilizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide students with an interactive interface where they can ask questions about the course and receive answers generated from the uploaded content.

Key Features
Professo Portal:

Secure Login System: Authentication mechanisms to ensure only authorized professors can access the admin features.
Course Creation and Management: Professors can create courses/subjects and organize them.
Content Upload: Ability to upload coursework sheets, lecture notes, reading materials, and supplementary resources.
Announcements Management: Post and manage course announcements.
FAQs Management: Upload manual answers to common questions, which are added to the RAG system.
Analytics Dashboard: Access usage statistics and common queries from students.
Student Portal:

Course Access Link: A unique link or portal where students can access course materials.
Interactive Q&A Interface: Students can ask questions related to the course.
RAG-powered Responses: The system provides answers by retrieving relevant information from the uploaded content and generating coherent responses.
Announcements Feed: Students receive the latest announcements from professors.
Feedback Mechanism: Option for students to provide feedback on the quality of answers. If answer not satisfactory send a request. 
Backend System (RAG Integration):

Document Indexing: Uploaded materials are processed and indexed for efficient retrieval.
Question Understanding: Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand student queries.
Answer Generation: Combine retrieved information with generative capabilities to formulate responses.
Continuous Learning: System improves over time by incorporating new materials and feedback.
